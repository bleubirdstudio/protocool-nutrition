Only 2 grams of carbohydrates. High concentration of BCAAs. Naturally & artificially flavored. When it comes to picking up the perfect protein to support optimal muscle growth and peak performance, you don't need a bunch of marketing hype and empty promises. What you need is a great-tasting, pure protein product of the very highest quality from a company you can trust. And with 100% Whey Protein from EAS, that's exactly what you get! Here's Why: 100% Whey Protein is pure, instantized whey protein processed through a series of low-temperature micro- and ultra-filtration steps, producing the cleanest, most intact form of whey protein available. This careful processing means that 100% Whey Protein is designed to provide the highest biological value protein available from any single protein source. It also means that the greatest possible concentration of bioactive microfractions is preserved. These microfractions are vital for promoting whey protein's famed immune enhancing effects. (References-Bounous, G and Gold, P., The biological activity of undenatured dietary whey proteins: role of glutathione. Clinical Investigative Medicine 14 (1991): 296-309.) Pure, clean whey protein is also absorbed into your body faster than any other protein, a benefit that has been demonstrated in research to enhance protein synthesis (muscle growth) by as much as 68%. (References-Boirie, Y et al., Slow and fast dietary proteins differently modulate postprandial protein accretion. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94 (1997): 14930-14935.) 100% Whey Protein also contains the highest naturally occurring levels of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), shown in research to help muscles recuperate more quickly from strenuous exercise. (References-Blomstrand, E. and Saltin, B., BCAA intake effects protein metabolism in muscle after but not during exercise in humans. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 2001 Aug; 281 (2): E365-74.)

Met-Max began with a concept, a concept that was initiated by professional bodybuilders in order to create the ultimate non-steroidal anabolic formula that would give elite athletes the edge in their quest for the perfect physique. To Achieve These Goals Met Max Had To: 1. Deliver a significant amount of high-quality protein. 2. Stimulate muscle growth. 3. Prevent/reduce muscle loss. 4. Increase fat loss. 5. Deliver energy. 6. Increase strength. Met Max delivers all this and more. Athletes plateau because their body stops responding to training. At some point, progress in fat loss, size, strength or stamina may slow down or stop altogether. Met-Max's special ingredients re-energize your metabolism to help you break through the barrier separating you from your goals. It is the first product of its kind specifically formulated to make your metabolism more responsive, so that you get results faster and with greater effect. For this reason, Met-Max's appeal has grown outside the market for bodybuilders and strength athletes to include professional and amateur athletes in the fields of football, baseball, hockey, basketball, track and cycling. The reason is well known to all who use it. They get results quickly. Met Max works for all types of athletes. Endurance athletes use Met Max to bust through stubborn plateaus-they increase stamina, recover faster and feel better at the end of their day. Strength athletes use Met Max because it helps them develop explosive power and size more quickly-and they accomplish this while gaining less fat than ever before. Because Met Max is formulated to make your metabolism more responsive, it is the one product that crosses all the lines from hardcore strength to hardcore endurance. In Order To Enhance: Muscle size, strength, power, stamina, fat loss, anti-catabolism and recovery, Met-Max contains the most complex combination of advanced, yet safe, performance enhancing ingredients ever assembled in one product.

Arginine-Aspartate-To improve the anabolic environment stimulated by strenuous exercise. OKG, Phosphatidylserine & L-Glutamine-Reduce cortisol-induced muscle catabolism and improve nitrogen balance. BCAA's, KIC and Succinates-To help you recover faster and reduce post-workout muscle soreness.

Great taste. Nitrogen rich. Mixes instantly, no blender required. Think your protein drink is giving you all the muscle you can get? Think again. Pure Whey Fusion gives you stronger workouts and superior recovery. This means: increased stamina. Increases strength. Improved nutrient intake and faster growth. Carbs and Protein Together Unlock Your Growth Potential. Most athletes know by now that the way to recover is to take protein before and after training. Research into nutrient timing has shown that you recover up to six times faster as a result. But new research shows that if you aren't getting carbohydrate with your protein during training you may be working your tail off for nothing! If you have stopped growing and don't know why, this may be your problem. If you have stopped getting stronger this may be the answer. If your stamina has been so-so, this may kick your workouts back into high gear. But Don't Carbs Make You Fat? Not when you take carbs during HIS! HIS means: High Insulin Sensitivity, a condition that occurs after twenty minutes of intense training and lasts up to a half-hour after training. During this time, carbs are driven straight into muscle to supercharge your workouts and create stored glycogen for tomorrow's torture session. Stronger workouts mean more muscle stimulation and that's how muscles start growing again. Do I Still Need Regular Protein? You may take pure protein at all other times of the day if you are trying to minimize carbohydrate intake, but during and immediately after training, use Pure Whey Fusion to maximize your gains. Pure Whey Fusion contains no creatine, table sugar, or added fat, just the highest grade of American-made protein and natural complex carbohydrates from maize. Excellent BCAA to EAA ratio.

More Protein, More Muscle Faster; Great tasting ProteinBlitz is your double strength delivery of rapid-release anabolic amino acids, perfect for pre-and-post workout muscle building. 20 years of published scientific research confirms that more muscle growth occurs with more protein intake and smart workouts. ProteinBlitz contains 60 g of peptide bound amino acids per serving. 16g Anti-Catabolic BCAAs; Branched Chain Amino Acids [BCAAs] are not digested normally. They are metabolized directly by muscles as fuel. Research proven to repair muscle micro-tears, BCAAs activate muscle genes and increased muscle growth. ProteinBlitz contains 16g of these powerful miniature muscle miracles. 8g Leucine-Your Muscle's Anabolic Driver; Leucine is the most important and powerful amino acid initiator of muscle anabolism. When combined with other amino acids and peptides-chains of amino acids-found in pure whey protein isolate, Leucine maximizes positive nitrogen balance in the body-the gold standard of anabolic potential and protein synthesis. With 8g of Leucine per serving, ProteinBlitz ingredients can help promote muscle growth. Three Steps to Faster Muscle Growth; Step 1-Pre-Workout-Preserving Your Hard-Gained Muscle; Use 1 serving of fast-acting ProteinBlitz 30 minutes before workouts to protect from the unwanted cellular destruction that occurs in minor muscles as they are broken down during exercise to help deliver fuel to the major working muscles in your body. ProteinBlitz with 16g of BCAAs, helps block unwanted muscle cell destruction and preserves your hardgained muscle. Step 2-Smart Training Primes Your Body to Grow; No matter what your goals are, specific resistance training and smart workouts create micro-tears in muscle plus natural hormonal responses. Smart resistance training primes your body to grow. Step 3-Satisfying Your Body's Anabolic Prime-Time; 20-30 minutes right after a workout is your body's Anabolic Prime-Time-exactly when your muscles are primed to grow the most.

Na-PCA with Aloe Vera is a Ph-Balanced, concentrated solution of the sodium salt of pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (the natural moisturizing factor found in human skin), combined with the highest quality aloe vera gel. Na-PCA is synthesized from glutamic acid, a nonessential amino acid. The skin contains natural moisturizers, the most important being Na-PCA. Old skin contains only about half the amount of Natural PCA as that found in young skin. The ability of skin to hold moisture is directly related to its Na-PCA content. It is water, and not oil, that keeps skin soft and supple. Na-PCA pulls water out of the air, moisturizing the skin, improving its appearance, and giving it a moist and youthful glow. This is not a cosmetic cover up; it is a physiological correction of an age-related deficiency state: Na-PCA with Aloe Vera provides quick relief from dry and cracked skin, burns, shaving irritations, detergent rash and other minor skin irritations. The aloe vera gel in this fine product is produced from the crystal clear gel of Aloe barbadensis Miller (Aloe vera linne) by a unique extraction and purification process exclusively developed by Twinlab.

Ultra anabolic weight gain formula. Natural & artificial flavor. Easily digestible 100% whey protein sources. Complex sugars only. Aspartame free. The science behind the size. While other products deliver the calories, we take a more scientific approach so that you gain muscle mass, not fat. Super Gainers Fuel Pro has been specifically formulated to the ratio of carbs/fat/protein used by professional body builders. This ultra advanced weight gain formula consists of only the highest quality protein from 100% whey sources, delivering this muscle boosting nutrient in its most bioavailable and digestible form. Rich in complex carbs, we've included high performance fat from MCT oil which helps increase energy and reduce muscle breakdown. Add a superior amino acid profile and increased antioxidant levels for enhanced recovery, and you've got the right combination to maximize your muscle growth. Product: a muscle cell volumizing formula, rich in complex carbohydrates, plus high biological-quality whey protein (100 g), Creatine monohydrate and chromium picolinate. Result: helps maximize anabolic drive and lean muscle mass by increasing muscle protein synthesis and preventing muscle protein breakdown, all without stomach upset. Science: clinical studies suggest the anti-catabolic synergism of carbohydrate-protein mixtures is more effective for post-exercise glycogen replenishment than carbohydrates alone. Super Gainers Fuel muscle cell volumizing formula taken after weight-training exercise can provide a cellular hydration state in muscle-and a hormonal environment during recovery that, preliminary studies suggest, may be favorable to protein synthesis and muscle growth. 1.
